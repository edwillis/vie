# Concept:
Vie is a turn-based competition of nation builders in the vein of the old BBS door games like Barren Realms Elite as well as paying homage to 1990s games from KOEI like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Nobunaga's Ambition.  Players assume the role of Kings of their initially small provinces in a fantasy world.  They recruit generals to expand their domains, lead armies into war and develop their territories.  They develop their generals over time to build formidable teams.  In keeping with the name, they vie against their fellow nascent nations, either headed by other players or run by AI and can form alliances (and break them!), use their generals to spy and perform clandestine operations to undermine their opponents, all while carefully managing the sentiment of the people in theis empires.  Vie appeals to the casual gamer who wants to enjoy the social aspects of gaming while getting in and out of their turns in short order as well as the hard core gamer who is happy to spend hours alone building their empires until all the world is under their control.
